        &lt;b&gt;0.8.1 (Feb 26, 2019)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - Fix build bug which is stopping F-Droid, now disable error on lint. Thank you edaubert!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - German translation by Luensche, thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;0.8.0 (May 26, 2018)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - From Android 8.1 COARSE_LOCATION permission is needed to access WiFi SSID! Also it seems
        that location services needs to be turned on as well, otherwise the SSID reported will
        be \"unknown ssid\".&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - Setting to run AN2Linux as a foreground service, thank you Eyenseo!&lt;br&gt;
        From Android Oreo (8.0) some new limitations about background services have been added to help
        with battery drain etc. Which means that AN2Linux might be killed by the system. So if you
        run Android Oreo+ and have problems with AN2Linux missing notifications, then you could try
        to run AN2Linux as a foreground service.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - Dutch translation by Vistaus, thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
        - Spanish translation by CalebCDE, thank you!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
